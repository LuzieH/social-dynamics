# You can comment like this

# You can feed params to functions and classes like this
my_function.function_arg_name = 10
my_class.class_arg_name = 'Halo'

# As long as functions and classes all have unique names, you don't have to worry about 
# what python file they are defined in. It will figure this out alone
